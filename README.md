# WEEK 1 — Core Java (Strong Foundation)
- Goal:
    - Think in Java. Write clean Java. Understand how Java actually works.

## Day 1–2: Java Fundamentals (But Properly)
- What Just Practiced
    - Encapsulation (private fields)
    - Constructor validation
    - Static variables
    - Method overriding
    - Object instantiation
    - Class interaction

## DAY 2 — Let’s Level Up (Collections)
- What We’re Learning Now
    - List<Student>
    - ArrayList
    - removeIf()
    - Lambda expressions
    - Method references
    - Basic in-memory CRUD
    - Backend logic simulation
    - OOP

## What we’ve Mastered So Far
- We now understand:
    - Collections
    - Streams
    - filter()
    - map()
    - count()
    - anyMatch()
    - Lambda expressions
    - Object comparison in Java
    - Service-layer style coding
- We’re already thinking like someone writing Spring Boot services.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
